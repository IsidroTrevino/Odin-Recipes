        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, 
            but let's go over the basics: If you want to stay true to the original recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll need to add to your grocery list:
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Meat:</b></li>
            <p>This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</p>

            <li><b>Onion and Garlic:</b></li>
            <p> An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</p>

            <li><b>Tomato products:</b> </li>
            <p>You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</p>

            <li><b>Sugar</b></li>
            <p>Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</p>

            <li><b>Spice and Seasonings</b></li>
            <p>This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, 
                and black pepper.</p>
            
            <li><b>Lasagna noodles</b></li>
            <p>Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</p>
            
            <li><b>Cheeses</b></li>
            <p>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</p>
            
            <li><b>Egg</b></li>
            <p>An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</p>
        </ol>

        <h2>How to make lasagna step-by-step</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Start by making the sauce: </b>with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. 
                The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
            <p></p>

            <li><b>Let this simmer hwile you boil and get the cheeses ready</b> We're using ricotta, shredded mozarella, and parmesan -- 
            like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
            <p></p>

            <li><b>From there, its just and assembly job!</b>  A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. 
                Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
                <p></p>

            <li><b>Bake until bubbly and ready to eat!</b></li>
        </ol>
